    "text": "about me\nLecturer in Psychophysiology and Cognitive NeuroscienceSchool of Psychology and Sport Science, Bangor University, UK\nI am a researcher. I am broadly interested in the areas of psychophysiology, cognitive neuroscience, and biomedical engineering.\nMy background is in Psychology. In 2007 I received a BSc in Psychological, Cognitive, and Psychobiological Sciences from the University of Padova (Italy) followed in 2009 by an MSc in Experimental Psychology and Cognitive-Behavioural Neuroscience. It was during these years that I developed my passion for psychophysiology. After completing my MSc degree, I continued working as a research assistant at the Department of General Psychology, University of Padova, and then at the School of Sport and Exercise Sciences, University of Birmingham (UK). I then returned to Italy to sit the State Examination for Psychology, which is necessary for the professional practice in psychology. While continuing my personal study in psychophysiology, I decided to formally study Sport and Exercise Sciences and in 2013 I completed a double MSc awarded jointly by Lund University (Sweden) and the University of Leipzig (Germany). In 2014-15 I worked as a research assistant at the Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Salzburg (Austria), deepening my study of electrophysiological signal processing. I returned to the UK in 2015 to start an ESRC-funded PhD in Psychophysiology at the University of Birmingham while at the same time completing a PGCert in Advanced Research Methods and Skills. As part of my doctoral training, I had the opportunity to visit the Cognitive Motor Neuroscience Laboratory of the University of Maryland. In 2018 I started a 2-year postdoctoral fellowship at the School of Sport, Exercise, and Health Sciences, Loughborough University. Since 2020 I have been a Lecturer at the School of Psychology and Sport Science, Bangor University, where I am a member of the research institutes for the Psychology of Elite Performance (IPEP) and for Applied Human Physiology (IAHP)."
