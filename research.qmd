In my research, I use and develop methods of computational psychophysiology to study the modulatory effect of cognitive processes (e.g., motor control, working memory, perception), psychological states (e.g., mental fatigue), and disease (e.g, essential hypertension) on biological systems (e.g., cortical, cardiovascular, ocular, somatic) and their interplay (e.g., cross-frequency cross-system coupling).
